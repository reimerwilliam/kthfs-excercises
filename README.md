# KTHFSDV Software Skills Training
**By: William Reimer**

The projects are using Python 2.7 and ROS Melodic Morenia

Instructions to run demo
1. Clone this repo into the src folder inside your catkin workspace

        git clone https://github.com/reimerwilliam/kthfs-excercises.git
    

2. Run `catkin build`

3. Start ros with the command `roscore`

4. In a new terminal run package2

         source ./devel/setup.bash
         rosrun package2 listener.py

5. In yet another new terminal run package1

        source ./devel/setup.bash
        rosrun package2 listener.py

    You can now inspect the messages being sent on the network with `rostopic echo /reimer`

6. Run exercise 2

        cd src/exc2
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python application.py

    Note: This project can technically be placed anywhere, just make sure the filepath on line 23 in result_chart.py points to the csv file generated by project2.
